## Description

Doer is a task management system designed to help users organize and manage their tasks efficiently. The system allows users to create, update, delete, and filter tasks through an intuitive web interface. It also supports different viewing options, such as gallery, list, and Kanban views, providing flexibility in how users interact with their tasks.

The application is built with a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and performance. The frontend is developed using React with Vite for a responsive and user-friendly interface. Authentication is handled using Google OAuth for seamless and secure user login. The backend, powered by FastAPI, provides RESTful endpoints to interact with the PostgreSQL database for robust data storage and management.

1. **Know which IPs were assigned to the Load Balancer**:
   - Run the command:
    ```bash
    host http://alb-doer-frontend-570455431.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/
    # alb-doer-frontend-570455431.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com has address 35.173.103.123
    # alb-doer-frontend-570455431.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com has address 3.232.9.83
    ```
   
2. **Edit the hosts file**:
   - Open the `/etc/hosts` file using a text editor:
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/hosts
     ```

3. **Add the ips**:
   - Append the the lines (use the ips yougot in **1.**):
     ```bash
     35.173.103.123  es-ua.ddns.net
     3.232.9.83      es-ua.ddns.net
